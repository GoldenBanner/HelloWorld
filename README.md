This is my first repository
I am a college graduate who majors in IMIS in China.Despite that,I didn't start my career as a software engineer.During my work time,I noticed that machine learning is changing our world rapidly and big opportunities are hidden inside this process.So I decided to catch the big trend and trying to make the most of it by being a software engineer.
